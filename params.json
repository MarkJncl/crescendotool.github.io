{"name":"The Crescendo Tool","tagline":"Formal design and modelling using Co-Simulation","body":"### Welcome to The Crescendo Tool.\r\n\r\nThe Crescendo Tool is an open-source tool originally developed in the [EU DESTECS (Design Support and Tooling for Embedded Control Software)](http://www.destecs.org/) research project.  The focus is on using co-simulation to design and modelling cyber-physical systems.  The tool is based on the [Overture platform](http://www.overturetool.org/) and [Controllab's 20-sim](http://www.controllab.nl/en/products/20-sim.html).\r\n\r\n### Getting the Crescendo tool.\r\n\r\nDownloads of ready-to-run versions of the Crescendo Tool are presently hosted on the destecs.org website (and are branded as the DESTECS tool); the current version is [Release 1.3.8](http://www.destecs.org/downloads.html).  We expect a Crescendo-branded version to be available soon.\r\n\r\n### Getting documentation.\r\n\r\nDocumentation may be found on [the download page](http://www.destecs.org/downloads.html) with the ready-to-run versions of the tool.\r\n\r\n### Getting the code.\r\n\r\nAll of the Crescendo code will soon be hosted on GitHub, under the @crescendotool organisation account.  Everyone is welcome to grab it, fork it, and contribute.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
